# Raw Accel

Raw Accel is a Windows 10 64-bit kernel driver which allows for the acceleration, or other modification, of mouse input in the raw input stream. It started as a replacement for the InterAccel program and Intercept driver, and has been extended with more acceleration types, charts, and other features.

## Anti-Cheat Friendly

Raw Accel will be signed to run as a fully trusted driver. It modifies mouse input only by a constant set of formulas and parameters, and has a one-second delay on writing settings to the driver, so it cannot be used to cheat.

## Development

Development of Raw Accel is ongoing at https://github.com/a1xd/rawaccel. Being a signed driver, the guts of the Raw Accel driver will be updated infrequently. The GUI can be updated as often was we like, however, so please let us know if you find any bugs.
